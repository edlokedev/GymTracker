# User Story: 2 - Log Workout Sets

**As a** gym user,
**I want** to log my workout sets with specific weights and reps for each exercise,
**so that** I can record my training performance and maintain accurate workout data.

## Acceptance Criteria

* User can select an exercise to log sets for
* User can input the weight used for each set
* User can input the number of repetitions completed for each set
* User can add multiple sets for the same exercise in one workout session
* Logged workout data is saved and persists between app sessions
* User receives confirmation when sets are successfully logged
* System supports common weight units (lbs, kg)

## Notes

* This is the core functionality of the gym tracker app
* Should include validation for reasonable weight and rep ranges
* Consider allowing users to edit or delete incorrectly logged sets
* The workout data forms the foundation for progress tracking
